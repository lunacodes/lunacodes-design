    <p>The work on this project was done for Jess Dobkin, a performing artist and curator, and involved creating dynamic and responsive custom templates for the main portfolio page, and for single portfolio projects; as well as utilizing Master Slider Pro’s Javascript API; and recoding theme components – such as the social media icons – in order to keep the website site with the lastest versions of WordPress and PHP.</p>
    <p>The main Portfolio page (called Work on the site) involved taking a two column static layout, and transforming it into a dynamic layout, where the number of columns displayed would change, based on screen size. The individual portfolio pages required a dynamic layout that accounted for the different categories of content presented on each project’s page. In order to accomplish making these pages responsive, I utilized the Advanced Custom Fields plugin.</p>
    <p>A key componenent of the individual portfolio pages was the slider featured at the top of the page.</p>
