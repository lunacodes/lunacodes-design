description: A database connecting composers and poets. Living Poetry Project is meant to eliminate barriers to access for both poets and composers. Poets have a platform to easily share their work with the world, and composers have a large repository of contemporary texts to search for use in their compositions. Rather than waiting months to obtain permission to use poetry in published collections, composers will be provided the contact information for each poet to negotiate arrangements for the use of the text in musical works.
