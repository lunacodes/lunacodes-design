description: A design revision of an existing custom WordPress Theme for a yoga studio. My work primarily focused on creating a more effective & visually crisp front page that would better serve to highlight the studio’s upcoming events & content. I achieved this by tightening up the header graphics, creating a 2-column & 3-column layout, and inserting graphical assets for the footer links. On the front page, I utilized dynamic content that could easily be modified by the yoga studio. In order to achieve this, I created new custom post types & custom page templates for the studio’s Press, Teachers & Upcoming Events pages.
