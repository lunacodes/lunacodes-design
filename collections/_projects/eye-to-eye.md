* Created a landing page for their newly featured “Empower Different Learners” iOS App, with a custom modal video player
* Developed periodic HTML email newsletters
* Transformed Adobe Photoshop and InDesign mockups into responsive webpages
* Collaborated the with design team by providing UX feedback, UI suggestions, mockups, and layouts

For the landing page, I translated a print-style design into functional website components. The different graphic elements either took the user to the iOS app store, or triggered a modal video player, with a full screen promo video. This functionality was added to the normal homepage as well.

Eye to Eye creates youth mentoring and advocacy programs for children with learning disabilities and ADHD.
