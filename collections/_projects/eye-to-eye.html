    <p>Eye to Eye creates youth mentoring and advocacy programs for children with learning disabilities and ADHD. In my work for Eye to Eye, I created a landing page for their newly featured “Empower Different Learners” iOS App. The project invovled transforming Adobe Photoshop and InDesign mockups into responsive webpages, as well as collaborating the with design team by providing UX feedback, UI suggestions, mockups, and layouts. Additionally, this project utilized static javascript and css code, instead of a dynamic system like WordPress. The main section of the page involved translating a print-style design into functional website components, where different areas of the main artwork triggered either the iOS app store or a modal video player that displayed a full screen promo video for the app. Additionally, the same design and functionality was incorporated into Eye to Eye’s homepage</p>
