I'm Luna - a friendly and enthusiastic Web Developer, based in Brooklyn, NY. I love teaching and helping my clients, just as much as I love creating beautiful websites for them.

I'm always learning and furthering my skills (currently leveling up on Node & React). When not programming, I enjoy playing cello, teaching myself Japanese, and studying Jewish history and halakha.
